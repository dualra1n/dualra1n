# dualra1n

A script that lets you dualboot iOS 14-15 (semi-tethered) on [checkm8](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit)-vulnerable devices. This is not a downgrade, however you can use [downr1n](https://github.com/edwin170/downr1n) which works fine on MACOS and Linux. not ios 16. 


# How would I dualboot?

- [A full tutorial](https://github.com/dualra1n/dualra1n/blob/main/tutorial.md)

- [Video tutorial from burhanrana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iCZv7Ox5AA)

# Dependencies
- A deactivated passcode on A10-A11
- An .iPSW file for iOS 14-15 
- Around 15 gigabytes of free storage
- A computer with macOS or Linux (if you have neither, you can temporarily "install" a Linux distro to RAM)

# Warnings
- I am **NOT** responsible for any data loss. The user of this program accepts responsibility should something happen to their device.
 **If your device is stuck in recovery, please run one of the following:**
   - futurerestore --exit-recovery
   - irecovery -n

# Ideal Dualboot Versions
on devices with A11 SoCs, dualbooting 14.2- or earlier will not boot so on those devices, use 14.3 upper instead.

iOS 13 is working but only 13.6, 13.7. (12, 11 not recommended) If you want to dualboot iOS 13,12,11 use the [ios13](https://github.com/dualra1n/dualra1n/tree/ios13) branch, use this command to change the branch: git checkout ios13. to come back to the normal branch use git checkout main.

# Common Issues

- iPhone and iPads may have issues with "Deep Sleep" (iOS not "waking up" after the display going to sleep). Installing the tweak [Fiona](https://www.ios-repo-updates.com/repository/julioverne-s-repo/package/com.julioverne.fiona/) or go to dualra1n-loader and click to fixdeepsleep option, may fix this.
