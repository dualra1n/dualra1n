# how to dualboot

Step 1: download your ipsw file which is wanted to dualboot. you can use --getIpsw that will do automatically however if that give error you must download manual and put the ipsw file into the ipsw/ directory 

Step 2: ./dualboot.sh --dualboot 14.3 (other options)

Step 3: when that is already installed and you would want to dualboot your second ios, you will have to use ./dualboot.sh --boot




# How to jailbreak 

1) Jailbreak with Pogo : to jailbreak your device: ./dualboot.sh --jailbreak 14.3 (or your version) remember that if you have palera1n jailbreak you have to put --jail_palera1n. Then after boot, open Pogo tap install, after that tap Do All. Then have fun.

2) Jailbreak with Taurine :  ./dualboot.sh --jailbreak 14.3 --taurine (if you have palera1n jailbreak use --jail_palera1n). After boot, open TV App and install Trollstore, then install ldid and rebuild icon cache. Taurine should appear on your homescreen, open it and tap jailbreak (If it shows Jailbroken, forget it and tap). when that reboot you can not press jsilbroken again or install taurine because that can give erros, each time that you reboot you will have to open pogo app and press do all (never press install because that can create conflict).
